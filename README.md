# Hello world!

## Welcome to my GitHub page

My name is Saksham Mittal, though I go by gotlou online. Feel free to go through my repositories for ideas of your own or for curiosity.

I'm fairly experienced with Python, MySQL, and can do basic HTML and CSS, judging from my website.

I have extensive experience with Linux, seeing as how I run it daily.

I'm currently learning C, and have gotten fairly good with it.

For more info, checkout [my website](https://gotlougit.github.io)

I'll update this page with more as time goes on..
