# Hello world!

## Welcome to my GitHub page

My name is Saksham Mittal, though I go by gotlou online. Feel free to go through my repositories for ideas of your own or for curiosity, or go to [my website](https://gotlougit.github.io) for more info.

I've been programming for a fairly long time, and tinkering with computers for much longer than that. In that amount of time, I'd say I've tried my hand at a lot of different aspects of computing:

- I've been daily driving Linux for ~5 years and am fairly comfortable with the command line (still learning shell scripting)

- I've messed around with MySQL.

- I've learned Python and C!

- I've built a website in the absence of any web frameworks or JavaScript.

- I learned Markdown to write better documentation and to also manage my own personal notes.

- I've learned how to use version control software to manage my projects and merge contributions in branches.

- I wrote a game with my friends [called panzer](https://github.com/gotlougit/panzer).

I'll update this list as time goes on...
